# SEngg-Project

## Abstract
The current project status report encapsulates our research endeavors centered on ChatGPT's interactions within the developer community, focusing on three pivotal areas. The first area of investigation involves a comprehensive analysis of programming language queries posed to ChatGPT, with an emphasis on identifying temporal shifts in language preferences. This segment is currently in the data collection and extraction phase. The second aspect delves into the variability of conversation lengths with ChatGPT, contingent upon the nature of the issues presented. This involves a methodical categorization of conversation types, a process that is presently being refined. The final facet of our research is concentrated on pinpointing the most prevalent prompts directed at ChatGPT by developers and critically analyzing the AI's response mechanisms. For this, we are in the initial stages of a thorough data mining exercise. The research utilizes sophisticated data analysis tools and adheres strictly to ethical standards in data handling. As we progress, we anticipate generating actionable insights, with subsequent updates planned to chronicle ongoing developments in this multifaceted research initiative. 

## Research Questions
1. How does the length of conversations with ChatGPT change based on the type of issue presented? - Chaitanya Guntupalli
2. What programming languages queries/prompts do developers ask ChatGPT? Exploring language preferences change over time? - Roochita Ikkurthy
3. What are the most common prompts that developers ask ChatGPT? How does ChatGPT answer those prompts? - Srinija Dharani

## Approach
Refer to the [Final Report](https://github.com/srinijadharani/SEngg-Project/blob/main/Group%2022%20FInal%20Report.pdf) for the detailed approach for each reseacrch question.

## Conclusion

1.	Code Versus No-Code Solutions: We analyzed what kinds of prompts developers normally asked ChatGPT. We found out that ChatGPT was asked to write scripts, generate code, and give examples of a particular concept. ChatGPT mostly gave code solutions to questions like these, but there were also very predominant no-code solutions where the developer and ChatGPT had conversations about some concepts.
2.	Programming Language Versus Categories:  Our analysis provides a detailed overview of the recent GitHub repository interactions, shedding light on language diversity, prompt categorization, and potential areas for further exploration. 
3.	Conversation Length: The results indicate that the type of issue presented enforces conversation length change and provides insight for developers about how to predict the length based on the issue presented.
